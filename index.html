    <p id="header"><i>"The Sherpas are a tribe of Tibetan origin who occupy the high valleys around the base of<br> 
                      Mount Everest in northeastern Nepal. In the Tibetan language, Shar Pa means "people who<br>
                      live in the east," and over time this descriptive term has come to identify the Sherpa<br>
                      community. According to Sherpa tradition, the tribe migrated to Nepal from the Kham region<br>
                      of eastern Tibet over a thousand years ago. Historians, however, suggest that the Sherpas<br>
                      were nomadic herders who were driven out of their original homeland in eastern Tibet by<br>
                      warlike peoples sometime between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries AD . They migrated<br>
                      to the area around Tingri, but conflict with the local inhabitants caused them to move<br>
                      on in search of new pastures. They crossed the Himalayas and settled peacefully in their<br>
                      present homeland in northeastern Nepal."</i></p>

    <p id="header2"><i>"The current Sherpa population is estimated to be around 45,000 people.<br>
                       They mainly live in the Khumbu and Solu Khumbu regions that lie to <br>
                       the south of Mount Everest. Sherpas also live to the east of this <br>
                       area in Kulung. In addition, Sherpas inhabit the valleys of the Dudh<br>
                       Kosi and Rolwaling Rivers west of Solu-Khumbu, and they are also found<br>
                       in the Lantang-Helambu region north of Kathmandu. Kathmandu itself has <br>
                       a sizable Sherpa population, while small numbers of Sherpas can be found<br>
                       throughout Nepal, even in the Terai. Sherpa communities are also present<br>
                       in the Indian state of Sikkim and the hill towns of Darjiling and Kalimpong.<br>
                       The Sherpas are small in stature, relatively fair in complexion, with the<br>
                       distinctive facial features associated with peoples of Tibetan origin."

        <p id="header3"><i>"The Sherpas belong to the Nyingmapa sect of Buddhism.<br>
                           The oldest Buddhist sect in Tibet, it emphasizes mysticism<br>
                           and incorporates shamanistic practices and local deities<br>
                           borrowed from the pre-Buddhist Bon religion. Thus, in addition<br>
                           to Buddha and the great Buddhist divinities, the Sherpa also<br>
                           have believe in numerous gods and demons who are believed to<br>
                           inhabit every mountain, cave, and forest. These have to be<br>
                           worshiped or appeased through ancient practices that have<br>
                           been woven into the fabric of Buddhist ritual life. Indeed,<br>
                           it is almost impossible to distinguish between Bon practices<br>
                           and Buddhism."

                "An important aspect of Sherpa religion is the monastery or gompa.<br>
                There are some two dozen of these institutions scattered through<br>
                the Solu-Khumbu region. They are communities of lamas or monks<br>
                (some-times of nuns) who take vows of celibacy and lead a life in<br>
                isolation searching for truth and religious enlightenment. They are<br>
                respected by and supported by the community at large. Their contact<br>
                with the outside world is limited to the annual festivals to which<br>
                the public is invited, and the reading of sacred texts at funerals."
